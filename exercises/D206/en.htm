<p>The Collatz conjecture, also called the $3n + 1$ conjecture, states that: Given a starting positive integer $N$, we can eventually obtain $N = 1$ after carrying out the following operation repeatedly:<br>
$N \leftarrow \begin{cases} N/2 &\text{if } N \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\\ 3N+1 & \text{if } N\equiv 1 \pmod{2} .\end{cases}$</p>
<p>For example, if we start from $N = 13$, the sequence would be: $13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$.</p>
<p>Write a program to print out the sequence.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of an integer $N$. $(1 \le N \le 100000)$</p>

<p>Output the sequence which starts from $N$ and ends at 1, in separated lines.</p>
