<p>Pak 7 is a simple but fun social game. Players take turns to call out numbers from 1 to 100. If the number to be called is a multiple of 7, or contains 7, the player should Pak (clap the hands) instead of the calling the number. You are not very good at the game. Write a program to help you.</p>
<p>Here we are going to generalize the game to Pak $N$, which means that we should Pak instead of calling it if the number is a multiple of $N$, or contains $N$ in its decimal representation.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of the integer $N$. $(2 \le N \le 9)$</p>

<p>Output the sequence from 1 to 100 in ten rows. Each row consists of 10 integers or Pak separated by spaces. The first row should represent 1 to 10 and the second row should represent 11 to 20, etc.</p>
