<p>You are about to write a simplified email address validation program. For this problem, assume that email addresses is valid if and only if it meets the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An email address consists of two parts separated by the \texttt{@} sign, like this: \texttt{username}\texttt{@}\texttt{host}
  <li>Username part:
  	<ul>
  	  <li>It should consist of one or more of the following characters: \texttt{0}-\texttt{9}, \texttt{a}-\texttt{z}, \texttt{A}-\texttt{Z}, \texttt{.} or \texttt{+}.
  	  <li>\texttt{.} may not appear in the beginning, or at the end, or consecutively.
  	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Host part:
  	<ul>
  	  <li>It should consist of three or more of the following characters: \texttt{0}-\texttt{9}, \texttt{a}-\texttt{z}, \texttt{A}-\texttt{Z}, \texttt{-} or \texttt{.}.
  	  <li>\texttt{.} may not appear in the beginning, or at the end, or consecutively. It also has to appear at least once.
  	  <li>\texttt{-} may not appear next to \texttt{.}</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
</ui>

<p>You should only implement the above rules. Do not make additional assumptions.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input is a string. The length of the string between 1 and 50. It will not contain spaces.</p>

<p>Check whether the string is a valid email address. It it is, output \texttt{Valid}. Output \texttt{Invalid} otherwise.</p>
