<p>Given a sorted array with $N$ integers and a list of numbers, for each of the $Q$ numbers, find out the smallest number larger than itself in the array.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $Q$. ($1 \le N \le 100000, 1 \le Q \le 100000).
<p>The second line contains of $N$ integers sorted in ascending order, separated by spaces.
<p>The third line contains of $Q$ integers, separated by spaces.
<p>All integers are in $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$ (the range of 32-bit integer).

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>For each number, output the smallest number larger than itself. If there is no such number, output \texttt{None}.
