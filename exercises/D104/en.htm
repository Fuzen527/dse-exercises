<p>The real root(s) of a quadratic equation with one variable $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are $x = \frac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} }}{{2a}}$</p>
<p>Write a program to solve a quadratic equation.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ in a line separated by spaces.</p>
<p>You may assume that $-100 \le a, b, c \le 100$.</p>

<p>If there are no real roots, output \texttt{None}.</p>
<p>If there is one real root, output the root in 3 decimal places.</p>
<p>If there are two real roots, output the roots in 3 decimal places separated by space or line. Output the lesser root first.</p>
