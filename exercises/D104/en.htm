<p>The root(s) of a quadratic equation with one variable $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are $x = \cfrac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} }}{{2a}}$</p>
<p>Write a program to solve for the real roots of a quadratic equation.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ in a line separated by spaces.
<br>You may assume that $-100 \le a, b, c \le 100$ and $a \ne 0$.</p>

<p>If there are no real roots, output \texttt{None}.
<br>If there is one real root, output the root in 3 decimal places.
<br>If there are two real roots, output the roots in 3 decimal places separated by space or line. Output the lesser root first.</p>
