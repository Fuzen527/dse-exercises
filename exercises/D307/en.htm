<p>In Tic-tac-toe, two players take turns to mark an empty cell in a $3 \times 3$ grid using their own symbol \texttt{X} or \texttt{O}. A player wins when 3 of his/her symbols form a vertical line, horizontal line or a diagonal.</p>
<p>Given the current state of a Tic-tac-toe game, determine which of the players has won.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of 3 lines of 3 characters. Each of the character could be \texttt{X}, \texttt{O} or \texttt{.}, which denotes an empty cell. It is guaranteed that it is a valid state. For example, if there is one \texttt{X}, there will be 0, 1 or 2 \texttt{O}s.</p>

<p>If one of the players wins, output \texttt{X wins} or \texttt{O wins}.<br>
If the game has ended (all 9 cells are marked) and neither player won, output \texttt{Draw}.<br>
If the game has not ended, output \texttt{Not ended}.</p>
