<p>In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$. The first few Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....</p>
<p>Write a program to find F_x.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of an integer $x$. $(0 \le x \le 40)$</p>

<p>Output $F_x$</p>
