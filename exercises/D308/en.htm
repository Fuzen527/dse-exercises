<p>A substring $T$ of $S$ is formed by selecting some consecutive characters in $S$. For example, \texttt{cde} is a substring of \texttt{abcdef} and \texttt{xyz} is a substring of \texttt{xyz}. Two substrings are said to be overlapping if they selected one or more the same character(s) in $S$. (Consider the characters' positions, not values.)</p>
<p>Write a program find out
<ul>
  <li>The number of occurence of substring $T$ in $S$.
  <li>The maximum number of non-overlapping substring $T$ in $S$.
</ul>
<p>For example, consider $S =\ $\texttt{ABABABA} and $T =\ $\texttt{ABA}. There are 3 substrings of $S$ that are equal to $T$ (1-3, 3-5 and 5-7). However, the maximum of non-overlapping substrings is only 2 (1-3 and 5-7).

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line is $S$ while the second line is $T$. Their lengths are between 1 and 50 inclusive. Both strings will contain uppercase letters only.</p>

<p>Output the answers in separate lines.</p>
