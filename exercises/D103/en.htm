<p>There are many ways to calculate the area of a triangle. One of them is to use the formula<br><span style="font-size: 120%">$area = \frac{1}{2}ab\;\textrm{sin}\;C$</span>,<br>where $a$ and $b$ are two side lengths of a triangle and $C$ is the the included angle between those two sides.
</p>

<p>Write a program to calculate the area using the inputs $a$, $b$ and $C$.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The three input values will be provided in separate lines. The first two lines contain the side lengths $a$ and $b$ and the third line contain the included angle $C$ in degrees. You may assume that $1 \le a, b \le 100$, $1 \le C \le 179$. Also, $a$, $b$ and $C$ are integers.</p>

<p>Finally, output the area corrected to 3 decimal places. You must output exactly 3 digits after the decimal point.</p>
