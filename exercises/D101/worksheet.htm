<h2>Declaring variables to store the input</h2>
<p>It is guaranteed that phone number is a 8-digit integer. Therefore we can use any suitable integer type to store the values.</p>
<pre class="pascal">var a: _________;</pre>
<pre class="npascal">_____ a;</pre>

<h2>Reading input from the standard input (keyboard)</h2>
<p>When we run the program, a console window appears. This console window is connected to the standard input and standard output of the program. That is why we can type in our input and also receive the output of the program. When the Enter key is pressed, the input is sent to the program.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at sample 1. The input is 23382338, so we type 23382338 and then press Enter.
<p class="pascal">The \texttt{readln} function reads input from the standard input. The value obtained will be stored into the variable specified in the parameter.
<pre>readln(a);</pre>
</p>
<p class="c">The \texttt{scanf} function reads input from the standard input. To use the function, we need to add \texttt{#include <stdio.h>} at the beginning of the program.The first parameter of the function is the format string. Here, \texttt{"%d"} specifies that the input would be an integer. Therefore, the value obtained will be stored to the address given <i>after</i> the format string.
<pre>scanf("%d", &amp;a);</pre>  
</p>
<p class="java">The \texttt{Scanner} class will help us read input from the standard input. To use the \texttt{Scanner} class, we need to add \texttt{import java.util.*;} at the beginning of the program. After creating a \texttt{Scanner} object, the input integer value can be obainted by calling its \texttt{nextInt()} method.
<pre>Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
a = in.nextInt();</pre>
</p>

<h2>Obtaining the first (most significant) digit of the number</h2>
<p>Next, let us extract the first digit of the phone number and store it in another integer variable \texttt{b}. Since the phone number is a 8-digit number, the first digit is equal to the quotient when the phone number is divided by 10,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pascal">In Pascal, we may use the integer division operator \texttt{div}.</span>
<span class="c">In C, </span><span class="java">In Java, </span><span class="npascal">we may use the \texttt{/} division operator. When both the operands are integers, it only returns the integer (quotient) part of the result instead of a real number.</span>
</pre>
<pre class="pascal">b: integer;
...
b := a div 10000000;</pre>
<pre class="npascal">int b = a / 10000000;</pre>
</p>

<h2>Determining the type (fixed / mobile)</h2>
<p>After variable \texttt{b} is set appropriately. What are the possible values of \texttt{b}?</p>

<p>Determine the type using \texttt{b}. Specifically, we can use the \texttt{if-else} control structure to do so. The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre class="pascal">if (condition1) then
  statement1
else if (condition2) then
  statement2
else
  statement3;
</pre>
<pre class="npascal">if (condition1) {
  statement1;
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2;
} else {
  statement3;
}</pre>
<p>When \texttt{condition1} is true, \texttt{statement1} will be executed. Otherwise, the program will skip \texttt{statement1} and continue considering the \texttt{else} cases. Assume that the first \texttt{if} is to check whether the prefix is 2. What should \texttt{condition1} be? (Hint: the equality comparison operator is \texttt{=<span class="npascal">=</span>})</p>

<h2>Outputting to standard output (console window)</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we have finished the conditions. The \texttt{statementx}s inside the \texttt{if} blocks are where we should output the result.
<span class="pascal">Text and values can be sent to the standard output using the \texttt{writeln} function. In Pascal, strings (texts) are enclosed with single quotes. Pass the appropriate string to the \texttt{writeln} function to display the result.</span>
<span class="c">Text and values can be sent to the standard output using the \texttt{printf} function. In C, strings (texts) are enclosed with double quotes. Pass the appropriate string to the \texttt{printf} function to display the result.</span>
<span class="java">In Java, there are several ways to output text and values to the standard output. One of the ways is to use the \texttt{System.out.println} function. Strings (texts) are enclosed with double quotes. Pass the appropriate string to the \texttt{System.out.println} function to display the result.</span>
<pre class="pascal">writeln(____________);</pre>
<pre class="c">printf(____________);</pre>
<pre class="java">System.out.println(____________);</pre>
</p>
<p>Place the output function calls in place of the \texttt{statementx}s.</p>

<h2>Testing the program</h2>
<p>After completing the program, you should test it using test cases. A test case consists of input and expected output. Enter the sample inputs given in the exercise, then compare your program's output to the sample output. Confirm that they are the same. It is a good practice to compose a few extra test cases. In this exercise, your test cases should cover all possible prefixes.</p>

<p>If you are confident that your program is correct, submit it to the HKOI Online Judge. Make sure that you select the correct programming language in the Submit page.</p>

<p class="pascal">Note: When submitting to the Judge, you must not include any external unit such as \texttt{uses crt;} and \texttt{uses wincrt;}.</p>
<p class="c">Note: When submitting to the Judge, you must \texttt{return 0;} (Return exit code 0 to the operating system) at the end of the program. Accordingly, the return type of the \texttt{main} should be \texttt{int}.</p>
<p class="java">Note: When submitting to the Judge, do not use non-default package. The main public class should appear immediately after the import statements, and the \texttt{main} function should be placed in that class. Example: 
<pre>import java.util.*;
public class ABC {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Bonus questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To better understand the flow of the program, draw the corresponding flowchart.</li>
  <li>Are the \texttt{else}s necessary in this exercise?</li>
  <li>Devise another way to obtain the first digit.</li>
  <li>In fact, this exercise can be solved in many ways. Rewrite the program:
    <ul>
      <li>Using the <span class="pascal">\texttt{case-of}</span><span class="npascal">\texttt{switch-case}</span> control structure.</li>
      <li>Without extracting the first digit (variable \texttt{b}).</li>
      <li>Using only one \texttt{if-else} structure. You may use the logical operator <span class="pascal">\texttt{or}</span><span class="npascal">\texttt{||} (or)</span>.)</li>
      <li>Using only one \texttt{if-else} structure and without extracting the first digit (variable \texttt{b}). In the condition, use the comparison operator \texttt{&lt;} (less than) only once and no other operators.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
