<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to perform with basic input and output. Also, you will be able to try the HKOI Online Judge system.</p>
<p>Write a program to read a 8-digit Hong Kong phone number and determine whether it is a fixed line number (numbers that start with 2 or 3) or a mobile number (numbers that start with 5, 6 or 9).</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The 8-digit phone number will be provided through the standard input. The number will not start with \texttt{999}.</p>

<p>After determining the correct type, output the word \texttt{fixed} or \texttt{mobile}. Our checker will ignore the prompts so it does not matter whether you output texts such as \texttt{Please enter phone number: } and \texttt{The phone number is a ...} or not. Your program will be judged as correct if the correct word \texttt{fixed} or \texttt{mobile} is somewhere in your output.</p>
