<p>Now, implement the Merge Sort sorting algorithm. One feature of Merge Sort is that it is stable, which means that when two elements have the same sorting keys, their relative order are maintained. For example, if an array contains \texttt{[(5, S), (7, D), (5, C), (6, H)]} and we want to sort it in ascending order of the number, a stable sorting algorithm would always give \texttt{[(5, S), (5, C), (6, H), (7, D)]} while an unstable sorting algorithm may give \texttt{[(5, C), (5, S), (6, H), (7, D)]}.</p>

<p>You are given list of $N$ game items. Each item contains two information: its cost (an integer) and its name (a string). Sort the list in ascending cost.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The first line contains the integer $N$, the number of items in the list ($1 \le N \le 100,000$).</p>
<p>Each of the $N$ lines describe an item: the cost $c_i$ and its name $s_i$. ($1 \le c_i \le 1,000,000,000$). The name is at most 100 characters long and contains lowercase letters only.</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>After sorting the list according to the costs, output the $N$ lines. Each line should contain the cost and the name separated by a space.</p>
