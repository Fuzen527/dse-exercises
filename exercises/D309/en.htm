<p>Write a program to determine which of the two strings is lexicographically smaller, ignoring case. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order" target="_blank">lexicographical order</a> is also known as dictionary order.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line is $S$ while the second line is $T$. Their lengths are between 1 and 100 inclusive. Both strings will contain uppercase and lowercase letters only.</p>

<p>Compare the two strings $S$ and $T$. If $S$ is lexicographically smaller than $T$ (case-insensitive), output \texttt{Smaller}. If $S$ is lexicographically greater than $T$ (case-insensitive), output \texttt{Greater}. Output \texttt{Equal} otherwise.</p>
