<p>Write a program to factorize a number $N$ into a product of primes.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of an integer $N$. ($2 \le N \le 10^9$)</p>

<p>Output the factorization of $N$ using a equality. The left hand side of the equality is $N$ while the right hand side should be a list of prime(s), from small to large, with the multiplication operator \texttt{*} between them.</p>
