<p>In this and the next exercise, we will learn how to implement the Merge Sort algorithm, which is much faster than Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.</p>
<p>Before that, we need to learn how to merge two sorted arrays efficiently.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$, the size of the two arrays respectively. ($1 \le N, M \le 100,000$)</p>
<p>The next line contains $N$ integers separated by spaces representing the first array.</p>
<p>The third line contains $M$ integers separated by spaces representing the second array.</p>
<p>The arrays are sorted in ascending order and the integers are in $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$.

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Output the merged array in one line. The $N + M$ integers should be separated by spaces and sorted in ascending order.</p>
