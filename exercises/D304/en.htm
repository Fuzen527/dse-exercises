<p>Hangman is a word guessing game. The game is played using a hidden English word $H$. Initially all its letters are hidden, but the player will know its length (the number of letters in the word). Next, the player will guess letters one by one. If $H$ contains the letter guessed, the letter and the position(s) will be revealed. For example, if $H$ = \texttt{abacus} and the player guesses \texttt{a}, \texttt{a_a___} will be shown to the player. The player will make guesses repeatedly until the all letters in $H$ are revealed.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The first line contains an English word $H$. It contains only lowercase English letters (no spaces) and its length is between 1 and 10 (inclusive). The next line contains the guessing sequence in order given as lowercase letters. The first letter in the string is the first letter guessed, and so on. You may assume that the letters are distinct and the game will end exactly at the last letter.</p>

<p>For each letter in the guessing sequence, reveal the suitable letters and output the result in a separate line with hidden letters replaced by underscores \texttt{_}.</p>
