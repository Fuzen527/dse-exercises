<p>Hangman is a word guessing game. The game is played using a hidden English word $H$. Initially all its letters are hidden, but the player will know its length (the number of letters in the word). Next, the player will guess letters one by one. If $H$ contains the letter guessed, the letter and the position(s) will be revealed. For example, if $H$ = \texttt{abacus} and the player guesses \texttt{a}, \texttt{a_a___} will be shown to the player. The player will make guesses repeatedly until the all letters in $H$ are revealed.</p>
<p>Write a program to simulate the game.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The first line contains an English word $H$. It contains only lowercase English letters (no spaces) and its length is between 1 and 20 (inclusive).</p>
<p>At this time, you may print some blank lines in order to hide the word entered.</p>
<p>Then, input the guessing sequence. They are given as lowercase letters one by one in separate lines. The letters are distinct. After each letter entered, reveal the suitable letters and output the result in a separate line with hidden letters replaced by underscores \texttt{_}.</p>
<p>Your program should end when the game ends (all letters have been revealed).</p>
