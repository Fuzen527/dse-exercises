<p>Note: You need to complete the exercise \texttt{D703} first.</p>

<p>After reading the linked list, you need to delete the $y^\text{th}$ element.</p>

<p>You should try to make minimal changes to the linked list. Specifically, you are only allowed to change one existing element. You can also change the head pointer if required.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The first three lines follow the same format as the previous exercise \texttt{D703}.</p>
<p>The fourth line contains one integer $y$. ($1 \le y \le\ $ size of the linked list).</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that it is not an empty linked list, i.e. $H \ne 0$</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>In the first line, output a single integer $H$, the (possibly changed) head of the linked list.</p>
<p>The second line should describe the element changed. If you decide not to change any existing element, output \texttt{-1}. Otherwise, output the array index of the changed element, new value and new next pointer separated by spaces.</p>
<p>Note: sometimes there are multiple possible answers. You may output any of them. (See samples 1/2 and 3/4)</p>
