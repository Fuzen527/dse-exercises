<p>Note: You need to complete the exercise \texttt{D703} first.</p>

<p>After reading the linked list, you need to insert a new element with value $x$ after the $y^\text{th}$ element. If $y$ is 0, that means to insert an element before the head of the linked list.</p>

<p>You should try to make minimal changes to the linked list. Specifically, you are allowed to create one new element and change one existing element. You can also change the head pointer if required.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The first three lines follow the same format as the previous exercise \texttt{D703}.</p>
<p>The fourth line contains two integers $x$ and $y$. ($1 \le x \le 10^9$, $0 \le y \le\ $ size of the linked list).</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>In the first line, output a single integer $H$, the (possibly changed) head of the linked list.</p>
<p>The second line should describe the new element created. Use array index $N + 1$ to store the new element. Output its value and next pointer separated by a space.</p>
<p>The third line should describe the element changed. If you decide not to change any existing element, output \texttt{No change}. Otherwise, output the array index of the changed element, new value and new next pointer separated by spaces.</p>
<p>Note: sometimes there are multiple possible answers. You may output any of them. (See samples 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6)</p>
