<p>Note: You need to complete the previous exercise first. Now add the following operations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>\texttt{INSERTHEAD} $x$: Insert an element with value $x$ before the first element in the linked list. (Do not change the pointer)
	<li>\texttt{INSERTAFTER} $x$: Insert an element with value $x$ after the element currently pointed at. (Do not change the pointer)
	<li>\texttt{DELETE}: Delete the element currently pointed at. (Move pointer to the next element)
	<li>\texttt{SIZE}: Find out the number of elements in the linked list, excluding the null element.
</ul>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The input format follows that of the previous exercise's. Except that there are additional kinds of operations.

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>When the operation is \texttt{QUERY}, output the value of the element pointed by the pointer. If the pointer is pointing at the null element (index = 0, which indicates end of linked list), output \texttt{End} instead.</p>
<p>When the operation is \texttt{SIZE}, output the number of elements in the linked list currently.</p>
