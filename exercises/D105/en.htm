<p>Write a program to compare two dates: $y_1 \dash m_1 \dash d_1$ and $y_2 \dash m_2 \dash d_2$.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line contains $y_1$, $m_1$ and $d_1$ separated by spaces. The second line contains $y_1$, $m_1$ and $d_1$ separated by spaces.</p>
<p>$1000 \le y_1, y_2 \le 9999$, and the dates are guaranteed to be valid.</p>

<p>If $y_1 \dash m_1 \dash d_1$ is earlier, output \texttt{Before}.</p>
<p>If $y_2 \dash m_2 \dash d_2$ is earlier, output \texttt{After}.</p>
<p>If the two dates are the same, output \text{Same}.</p>
