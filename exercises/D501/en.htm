<p>The Heung Shing Bank is the largest bank in Heung Shing. It stores customer account transactions in files. Write a program to read the transaction history of an account from a file and display the final balance.</p>

<p>Initially the account balance is 0 dollars. Each transaction, represented by an non-zero integer, is saved in a separate line in order. A positive integer $x$ means that the customer has deposited $x$ dollars into the account while a negative integer $-x$ means that the customer has withdrawn $x$ dollars from the account. It is guaranteed that the account balance will not become negative at any time. </p>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The input is stored in the file \texttt{account.txt}. The first line in the file contains an integer $N$, the number of transactions ($0 \le N \le 100$).</p>
<p>The following $N$ lines in the file each contains an integer $x_i$ representing a transaction. ($-1000 \le x_i \le 1000$, $x \ne 0$)</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Output an integer to the standard output (screen): the final balance of the account.</p>
