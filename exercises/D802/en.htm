<p>Implement the Bubble Sort sorting algorithm. Sort the given array in the specified order.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $A$. $N$ is the number of integers in the array. $A$ is the sorting order required (0 = Ascending, 1 = Descending).</p>
<p>The next line contains $N$ integers separated by spaces. The integers are in $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$ (the range of 32-bit integer).</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Output two integers on the first line: the number of comparisons performed and the minimum number of swaps required.</p>
<p>On the second line should contain the sorted array. Output $N$ numbers separated by spaces.</p>
